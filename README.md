Assignment Module 2
For this assignment, I have created a VBA code to analyze the mutilpe year stock data.
I have looped in years 2018, 2019 and 2020 worksheets in excel
On each of the worksheets created headings to define "Ticker", "Yearly Change", "Percent change", "Total Stock Volume", "Greatedt % Increase", "Greatest % decrease and Greatest Total Volume.
Used For loop, Conditional formatting, color formatting
Challenges:
Had challenges calculating the Yearly Change and Total Stock Volume (faced challenges in setting up the correct loop to get the desired result.)
